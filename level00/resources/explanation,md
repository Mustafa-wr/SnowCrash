we tried to see all accessable files by "flag00" user by this command
"find / -user flag00"

we found then there are two files
/usr/sbin/john
&
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

and both of them has this content

cdiiddwpgswtgt
in the cachesleuth website we put the content and found that its rot15
https://www.cachesleuth.com/multidecoder/

will give us "nottoohardhere"

putting it as a password for flag00 user and we got the flag by "flag00" command
